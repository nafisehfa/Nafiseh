## Welcome 

I'm Nafiseh Farahzadi and I recently graduated with a master’s degree in Communication Engineering from Amirkabir University. My thesis was about microwave imaging for brain stroke detection.see the abstract underhere.

Abstract— In this paper, the feasibility of microwave brain stroke detection in three dimensions is examined with a time-reversal (TR) algorithm. At first, a focusing criterion that automatically selects the optimum frame of the constructed image is presented. Then, a localization technique based on the temporal integration of time-reversed fields is used. An array of dipole antennas are used as transmitters and receivers in the imaging system. Simulation results for homogeneous and heterogeneous models of the brain demonstrate the capability of this imaging system for the detection of blood clot location within the brain at the frequency range of 0.8-1 GHz.
